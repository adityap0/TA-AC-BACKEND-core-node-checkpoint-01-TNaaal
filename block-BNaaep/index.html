          The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960. The
          group, whose best-known line-up comprised John Lennon, Paul McCartney,
          George Harrison and Ringo Starr, are regarded as the most influential
          band of all time. They were integral to the development of 1960s
          counterculture and popular music's recognition as an art form. Rooted
          in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock and roll, their sound incorporated
          elements of classical music and traditional pop in innovative ways;
          the band later explored music styles ranging from ballads and Indian
          music to psychedelia and hard rock. As pioneers in recording,
          songwriting and artistic presentation, the Beatles revolutionised many
          aspects of the music industry and were often publicised as leaders of
          the era's youth and sociocultural movements.
